You don't even know what I've been through
You don't gotta like me, ya bitch do
Blowin' up my phone like, I miss you.
You know I love you by the way that I kiss you
It keeps on tellin' me
Peep, leave it alone, I'm good on my own
Mama miss me at home, but I'm good on my own
Show after show, fuckin' ho' after ho
I swear it gets so lonely sometimes
Please, just hold me one time
Fuck these hoes and fuck life
